The Nazi plan of mass murder of the Jewish population was in full motion. As battles were being fought between countries, Jews were being rounded up and sent to concentration camps throughout Europe. This process began a mass exodus of people out of Europe, especially those in the Jewish community.\n(3)\nDuring the war, members of the Jewish community used every tool and means at their disposal to flee Nazi tyranny. Thousands tried to flee on trains or boats to escape from Europe.\n(4)\nWhile the armies of countries were fighting each other, a handful of diplomats, from around the world, stepped forward and took heroic actions to save Jews fleeing Europe. This was an incredibly dangerous process. If the Nazis discovered the actions of these diplomats they would be expelled, as a few of them were. Also, while worrying about the Nazis, diplomats had to worry about their careers and livelihoods back home. Many of them had strict orders from their home countries to not aid the Jewish population in any way.\n(5)\nThese diplomats used every means at their disposal to help Jews fleeing persecution. One of the most powerful tools the diplomats had to use was the issuing of passports and travel visas contrary to the instruction of the governments of the diplomats. This process alone is responsible for saving hundreds of thousands of Jewish families in Europe. This was not the only tool used as many of the diplomats were connected with the local populations and were great communicators for Jews trying to travel underground. They were able set up safehouses and getaways to hide Jews and especially Jewish children from Nazi authorities. In the most dangerous of times, several of these diplomats confronted the Nazis directly on behalf of the Jews and personally put themselves in grave danger.\n(6)\nEvery diplomat knew the dangers and knew what they were up against, and still pushed forward to save those in the most danger.\n(7)\nThe Congressional Gold Medal authorized under this Act will help remind humanity that when the diplomats were faced with terrible crises, they went beyond the fold, including risking their careers and the lives of themselves and their families, to engage in this humanitarian mission. The diplomats of today and future generations can look towards these heroes and be inspired by their lives of heroism and sacrifice.\n(8)\nNothing in this Act shall be construed as stating or implying that this group of honorees encompasses everyone who took this type of heroic action during this era. As the title attests, the\nForgotten Heroes\n3.\nCongressional gold medal\n(a)\nPresentation authorized\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in honor of the 60 diplomats identified in section 2(1), in recognition of their brave and vital service of saving Jews during World War II.\n(b)\nDesign and striking\nFor purposes of the presentation referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this Act as the\nSecretary\n(c)\nPresentation of medal\nThe single gold medal presented under subsection (a) shall be presented collectively to the eldest next of kin of each of the 60 diplomats identified in section 2(1), who shall receive the medal as part of a delegation consisting of a senior official representative of the country that each diplomat served and the cochairs of the Forgotten Heroes of the Holocaust Committee.\n(d)\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum\n(1)\nIn general\nFollowing the award of the gold medal in honor of the 60 diplomats identified in section 2(1), the gold medal shall be given to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, where it will be available for display as appropriate and available for research.\n(2)\nSense of Congress\nIt is the sense of Congress that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum should make the gold medal awarded pursuant to this Act available for display elsewhere, particularly at appropriate locations associated with Holocaust remembrance.\n4.\nDuplicate medals\nThe Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under section 3, at a price sufficient to cover the costs thereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.\n5.\nStatus of medals\n(a)\nNational medal\nMedals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals for purposes of\nchapter 51\n(b)\nNumismatic items\nFor purposes of sections 5134 and 5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n6.\nAuthority to use fund amounts; proceeds of sale\n(a)\nAuthority To use fund amounts\nThere is authorized to be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of the medals struck under this Act.\n(b)\nProceeds of sale\nAmounts received from the sale of duplicate bronze medals authorized under section 4 shall be deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives\nVice President of the United States and President of the Senate",

R. 4\nIN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\nSeptember 14, 2021\nReceived\nAN ACT\nTo amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to revise the criteria for determining which States and political subdivisions are subject to section 4 of the Act, and for other purposes.\n1.\nShort title\nThis Act may be cited as the\nJohn R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021\n2.\nVote dilution, denial, and abridgment claims\n(a)\nIn general\nSection 2(a) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (\n52 U.S.C. 10301(a)\n(1)\nby inserting after\napplied by any State or political subdivision\nfor the purpose of, or\n(2)\nby striking\nas provided in subsection (b)\nas provided in subsection (b), (c), (d), or (f)\n(b)\nVote dilution\nSection 2(b) of such Act (\n52 U.S.C. 10301(b)\n(1)\nby inserting after\nA violation of subsection (a)\nfor vote dilution\n(2)\nby inserting after the period at the end the following:\nFor the purposes of this subsection:\n(3)\nby adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n(1)\nTo prevail in demonstrating that a representational, districting, or apportionment scheme results in vote dilution, a plaintiff shall, as a threshold matter, establish that\u2014\n(A)\nthe members of the protected class are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district;\n(B)\nthe members of the protected class are politically cohesive; and\n(C)\nthe residents of that district who are not the members of the protected class usually vote sufficiently as a bloc to enable them to defeat the preferred candidates of the members of the protected class.\n(2)\nUpon a plaintiff establishing the required threshold showing under paragraph (1), a court shall conduct a totality of the circumstances analysis with respect to a claim of vote dilution to determine whether there was a violation of subsection (a), which shall include the following factors:\n(A)\nThe extent of any history of official voting discrimination in the State or political subdivision that affected the right of members of the protected class to register, to vote, or otherwise to participate in the political process.\n(B)\nThe extent to which voting in the elections of the State or political subdivision is racially polarized.\n(C)\nThe extent to which the State or political subdivision has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the members of the protected class, such as unusually large election districts, majority vote requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or other qualifications, prerequisites, standards, practices, or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the members of the protected class.\n(D)\nIf there is a candidate slating process, whether the members of the protected class have been denied access to that process.\n(E)\nThe extent to which members of the protected class in the State or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination, both public or private, in such areas as education, employment, health, housing, and transportation, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process.\n(F)\nWhether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals.\n(G)\nThe extent to which members of the protected class have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.\n(3)\nIn conducting a totality of the circumstances analysis under paragraph (2), a court may consider such other factors as the court may determine to be relevant, including\u2014\n(A)\nwhether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the members of the protected class, including a lack of concern for or responsiveness to the requests and proposals of the members of the protected class, except that compliance with a court order may not be considered evidence of responsiveness on the part of the jurisdiction; and\n(B)\nwhether the policy underlying the State or political subdivision\u2019s use of such voting qualification, prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice or procedure is tenuous.\nIn making this determination, a court shall consider whether the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure in question was designed to advance and materially advances a valid and substantiated State interest.\n(4)\nA class of citizens protected by subsection (a) may include a cohesive coalition of members of different racial or language minority groups.\n; and\n(4)\nVote denial or abridgement\nSection 2 of such Act (\n52 U.S.C. 10301\n(c)\n(1)\nA violation of subsection (a) resulting in vote denial or abridgment is established if the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure\u2014\n(A)\nresults or will result in members of a protected class facing greater costs or burdens in participating in the political process than other voters; and\n(B)\nthe greater costs or burdens are, at least in part, caused by or linked to social and historical conditions that have produced or produce on the date of such challenge discrimination against members of the protected class.\nIn determining the existence of a burden for purposes of subparagraph (A), the absolute number or the percent of voters affected or the presence of voters who are not members of a protected class in the affected area shall not be dispositive, and the affected area may be smaller than the jurisdiction to which the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure applies.\n(2)\nThe challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure need only be a but-for cause of the discriminatory result described in paragraph (1) or perpetuate a pre-existing burdens or costs.\n(3)\n(A)\nThe factors that are relevant to a totality of the circumstances analysis with respect to a claim of vote denial or abridgement pursuant to this subsection include the following:\n(i)\nThe extent of any history of official voting-related discrimination in the State or political subdivision that affected the right of members of the protected class to register, to vote, or otherwise to participate in the political process.\n(ii)\nThe extent to which voting in the elections of the State or political subdivision is racially polarized.\n(iii)\nThe extent to which the State or political subdivision has used photographic voter identification requirements, documentary proof of citizenship requirements, documentary proof of residence requirements, or other voting practices or procedures, beyond those required by Federal law, that impair the ability of members of the minority group to participate fully in the political process.\n(iv)\nThe extent to which minority group members bear the effects of discrimination, both public or private, in areas such as education, employment, health, housing, and transportation, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process.\n(v)\nThe use of overt or subtle racial appeals either in political campaigns or surrounding adoption or maintenance of the challenged practice.\n(vi)\nThe extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction, provided that the fact that the minority group is too small to elect candidates of its choice shall not defeat a claim of vote denial or abridgment.\n(vii)\nWhether there is a lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of minority group members, including a lack of concern for or responsiveness to the requests and proposals of the group, except that compliance with a court order may not be considered evidence of responsiveness on the part of the jurisdiction.\n(viii)\nWhether the policy underlying the State or political subdivision's use of the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure is tenuous. In making a determination under this clause, a court shall consider whether the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure in question was designed to advance and materially advances a valid and substantiated State interest.\n(ix)\nSubject to paragraph (4), such other factors as the court may determine to be relevant.\n(B)\nThe factors described in subparagraph (A), individually and collectively, shall be considered as a means of establishing that a voting practice amplifies the effects of past or present discrimination in violation in subsection (a).\n(C)\nA plaintiff need not show any particular combination or number of factors to establish a violation of subsection (a).\n(4)\nThe factors that are relevant to a totality of the circumstances analysis with respect to a claim of vote denial or abridgement do not include the following:\n(A)\nThe degree to which the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure has a long pedigree or was in widespread use at some earlier date.\n(B)\nThe use of an identical or similar qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure in other States or jurisdictions.\n(C)\nThe availability of other forms of voting unimpacted by the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure to all members of the electorate, including members of the protected class, unless the jurisdiction is simultaneously expanding such other practices to eliminate any disproportionate burden imposed by the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure.\n(D)\nUnsubstantiated defenses that the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure is necessary to address criminal activity.\n(d)\n(1)\nA violation of subsection (a) for the purpose of vote denial or abridgement is established if the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure is intended, at least in part, to dilute minority voting strength or to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 4(f)(2).\n(2)\nDiscrimination on account of race, color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 4(f)(2) need only be one purpose of a qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure to demonstrate a violation of subsection (a).\n(3)\nA qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure intended to dilute minority voting strength or to make it more difficult for minority voters to cast a ballot that will be counted violates this subsection even if an additional purpose of the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure is to benefit a particular political party or group.\n(4)\nThe context for the adoption of the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure, including actions by official decisionmakers before the challenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure, may be relevant to a violation of this subsection.\n(5)\nClaims under this subsection require proof of a discriminatory impact but do not require proof of a violation pursuant to subsection (b) or (c).\n(e)\nFor purposes of this section, the term\naffected area\n.\n3.\nRetrogression\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (\n52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.\n(f)\nA violation of subsection (a) is established when a State or political subdivision enacts or seeks to administer any qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting in any election that has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 4(f)(2), to participate in the electoral process or elect their preferred candidates of choice. This subsection applies to any action taken on or after January 1, 2021, by a State or political subdivision to enact or seek to administer any such qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice or procedure.\n(g)\nNotwithstanding the provisions of subsection (f), final decisions of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia on applications or petitions by States or political subdivisions for preclearance under section 5 of any changes in voting prerequisites, standards, practices, or procedures, supersede the provisions of subsection (f).\n.\n4.\nViolations triggering authority of court to retain jurisdiction\n(a)\nTypes of Violations\nSection 3(c) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (\n52 U.S.C. 10302(c)\nviolations of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment\nviolations of the 14th or 15th Amendment, violations of this Act, or violations of any Federal law that prohibits discrimination in voting on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group,\n(b)\nConforming Amendment\nSection 3(a) of such Act (\n52 U.S.C. 10302(a)\nviolations of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment\nviolations of the 14th or 15th Amendment, violations of this Act, or violations of any Federal law that prohibits discrimination in voting on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group,\n5.\nCriteria for coverage of States and political subdivisions\n(a)\nDetermination of States and Political Subdivisions Subject to Section 4(\na\n(1)\nIn general\nSection 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (\n52 U.S.C. 10303(b)\n(b)\nDetermination of States and Political Subdivisions Subject to Requirements\n(1)\nExistence of voting rights violations during previous 25 years\n(A)\nStatewide application\nSubsection (a) applies with respect to a State and all political subdivisions within the State during a calendar year if\u2014\n(i)\nfifteen or more voting rights violations occurred in the State during the previous 25 calendar years;\n(ii)\nten or more voting rights violations occurred in the State during the previous 25 calendar years, at least one of which was committed by the State itself (as opposed to a political subdivision within the State); or\n(iii)\nthree or more voting rights violations occurred in the State during the previous 25 calendar years and the State itself administers the elections in the State or political subdivisions in which the voting rights violations occurred.\n(B)\nApplication to specific political subdivisions\nSubsection (a) applies with respect to a political subdivision as a separate unit during a calendar year if three or more voting rights violations occurred in the subdivision during the previous 25 calendar years.\n(2)\nPeriod of application\n(A)\nIn general\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (B), if, pursuant to paragraph (1), subsection (a) applies with respect to a State or political subdivision during a calendar year, subsection (a) shall apply with respect to such State or political subdivision for the period\u2014\n(i)\nthat begins on January 1 of the year in which subsection (a) applies; and\n(ii)\nthat ends on the date which is 10 years after the date described in clause (i).\n(B)\nNo further application after declaratory judgment\n(i)\nStates\nIf a State obtains a declaratory judgment under subsection (a), and the judgment remains in effect, subsection (a) shall no longer apply to such State pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) unless, after the issuance of the declaratory judgment, paragraph (1)(A) applies to the State solely on the basis of voting rights violations occurring after the issuance of the declaratory judgment.\n(ii)\nPolitical subdivisions\nIf a political subdivision obtains a declaratory judgment under subsection (a), and the judgment remains in effect, subsection (a) shall no longer apply to such political subdivision pursuant to paragraph (1), including pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) (relating to the statewide application of subsection (a)), unless, after the issuance of the declaratory judgment, paragraph (1)(B) applies to the political subdivision solely on the basis of voting rights violations occurring after the issuance of the declaratory judgment.\n(3)\nDetermination of voting rights violation\nFor purposes of paragraph (1), a voting rights violation occurred in a State or political subdivision if any of the following applies:\n(A)\nJudicial relief;

violations of this Act\nAny final judgment, or any preliminary, temporary, or declaratory relief (that was not reversed on appeal) in which the plaintiff prevailed or a court of the United States found that the plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or raised a serious question with regard to race discrimination, in which any court of the United States determined that a voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting was imposed or applied or would have been imposed or applied anywhere within the State or subdivision in a manner that resulted or would have resulted in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group, in violation of subsection 4(e) or 4(f) or section 2, 201, or 203 of this Act.\n(C)\nFinal judgment; Denial of declaratory judgment\nIn a final judgment (that was not been reversed on appeal), any court of the United States has denied the request of the State or subdivision for a declaratory judgment under section 3(c) or section 5, and thereby prevented a voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting from being enforced anywhere within the State or subdivision.\n(D)\nObjection by the Attorney General\nThe Attorney General has interposed an objection under section 3(c) or section 5, and thereby prevented a voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting from being enforced anywhere within the State or subdivision. A violation per this subsection has not occurred where an objection has been withdrawn by the Attorney General, unless the withdrawal was in response to a change in the law or practice that served as the basis of the objection. A violation under this subsection has not occurred where the objection is based solely on a State or political subdivision\u2019s failure to comply with a procedural process that would not otherwise constitute an independent violation of this act.\n(E)\nConsent decree, settlement, or other agreement\nA consent decree, settlement, or other agreement was adopted or entered by a court of the United States or contained an admission of liability by the defendants, which resulted in the alteration or abandonment of a voting practice anywhere in the territory of such State or subdivision that was challenged on the ground that the practice denied or abridged the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group in violation of subsection 4(e) or 4(f) or section 2, 201, or 203 of this Act, or the 14th or 15",

R. 5\nIN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\nMarch 1, 2021\nReceived\nMarch 2 (legislative day, March 1), 2021\nRead the first time\nMarch 2, 2021\nRead the second time and placed on the calendar\nAN ACT\nTo prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation, and for other purposes.\n1.\nShort title\nThis Act may be cited as the\nEquality Act\n2.\nFindings and purpose\n(a)\nFindings\nCongress finds the following:\n(1)\nDiscrimination can occur on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes. Each of these factors alone can serve as the basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex discrimination.\n(2)\nA single instance of discrimination may have more than one basis. For example, discrimination against a married same-sex couple could be based on the sex stereotype that marriage should only be between heterosexual couples, the sexual orientation of the two individuals in the couple, or both. In addition, some persons are subjected to discrimination based on a combination or the intersection of multiple protected characteristics. Discrimination against a pregnant lesbian could be based on her sex, her sexual orientation, her pregnancy, or on the basis of multiple factors.\n(3)\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (referred to as\nLGBTQ\n(4)\nWomen also have faced discrimination in many establishments such as stores and restaurants, and places or establishments that provide other goods or services, such as entertainment or transportation, including sexual harassment, differential pricing for substantially similar products and services, and denial of services because they are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n(5)\nMany employers already and continue to take proactive steps, beyond those required by some States and localities, to ensure they are fostering positive and respectful cultures for all employees. Many places of public accommodation also recognize the economic imperative to offer goods and services to as many consumers as possible.\n(6)\nRegular and ongoing discrimination against LGBTQ people, as well as women, in accessing public accommodations contributes to negative social and economic outcomes, and in the case of public accommodations operated by State and local governments, abridges individuals\u2019 constitutional rights.\n(7)\nThe discredited practice known as\nconversion therapy\n(8)\nBoth LGBTQ people and women face widespread discrimination in employment and various services, including by entities that receive Federal financial assistance. Such discrimination\u2014\n(A)\nis particularly troubling and inappropriate for programs and services funded wholly or in part by the Federal Government;\n(B)\nundermines national progress toward equal treatment regardless of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity; and\n(C)\nis inconsistent with the constitutional principle of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n(9)\nFederal courts have widely recognized that, in enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress validly invoked its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment to provide a full range of remedies in response to persistent, widespread, and pervasive discrimination by both private and government actors.\n(10)\nDiscrimination by State and local governments on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing, and public accommodations, and in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In many circumstances, such discrimination also violates other constitutional rights such as those of liberty and privacy under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n(11)\nIndividuals who are LGBTQ, or are perceived to be LGBTQ, have been subjected to a history and pattern of persistent, widespread, and pervasive discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity by both private sector and Federal, State, and local government actors, including in employment, housing, and public accommodations, and in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance. This discrimination inflicts a range of tangible and intangible harms, sometimes even including serious physical injury or death. An explicit and comprehensive national solution is needed to address this discrimination, including the full range of remedies available under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n(12)\nDiscrimination based on sexual orientation includes discrimination based on an individual\u2019s actual or perceived romantic, emotional, physical, or sexual attraction to other persons, or lack thereof, on the basis of gender. LGBTQ people, including gender nonbinary people, also commonly experience discrimination because of sex-based stereotypes. Many people are subjected to discrimination because of others\u2019 perceptions or beliefs regarding their sexual orientation. Even if these perceptions are incorrect, the identity imputed by others forms the basis of discrimination.\n(13)\nNumerous provisions of Federal law expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, and Federal courts and agencies have correctly interpreted these prohibitions on sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex stereotypes. In particular, the Supreme Court of the United States correctly held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) that the prohibition on employment discrimination because of sex under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 inherently includes discrimination because of sexual orientation or transgender status.\n(14)\nThis Act makes explicit that existing Federal statutes prohibiting sex discrimination in employment (including in access to benefits), healthcare, housing, education, credit, and jury service also prohibit sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination.\n(15)\nLGBTQ people often face discrimination when seeking to rent or purchase housing, as well as in every other aspect of obtaining and maintaining housing. LGBTQ people in same-sex relationships are often discriminated against when two names associated with one gender appear on a housing application, and transgender people often encounter discrimination when credit checks or inquiries reveal a former name.\n(16)\nNational surveys, including a study commissioned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, show that housing discrimination against LGBTQ people is very prevalent. For instance, when same-sex couples inquire about housing that is available for rent, they are less likely to receive positive responses from landlords. A national matched-pair testing investigation found that nearly one-half of same-sex couples had encountered adverse, differential treatment when seeking elder housing. According to other studies, transgender people have half the homeownership rate of non-transgender people and about 1 in 5 transgender people experience homelessness. Another survey found that 82 percent of gender nonbinary people experiencing homelessness lacked access to shelter.\n(17)\nAs a result of the absence of explicit prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, credit applicants who are LGBTQ, or are perceived to be LGBTQ, have unequal opportunities to establish credit. LGBTQ people can experience being denied a mortgage, credit card, student loan, or many other types of credit simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n(18)\nNumerous studies demonstrate that LGBTQ people, especially transgender people and women, are economically disadvantaged and at a higher risk for poverty compared with other groups of people. For example, the poverty rate for older women in same-sex couples is twice that of older different-sex couples.\n(19)\nThe right to an impartial jury of one\u2019s peers and the reciprocal right to jury service are fundamental to the free and democratic system of justice in the United States and are based in the Bill of Rights. There is, however, an unfortunate and long-documented history in the United States of attorneys discriminating against LGBTQ individuals, or those perceived to be LGBTQ, in jury selection. Failure to bar peremptory challenges based on the actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of an individual not only erodes a fundamental right, duty, and obligation of being a citizen of the United States, but also unfairly creates a second class of citizenship for LGBTQ victims, witnesses, plaintiffs, and defendants.\n(20)\nNumerous studies document the shortage of qualified and available homes for the approximately 424,000 youth in the child welfare system and the negative outcomes for the many youth who live in group care as opposed to a loving home or who age out of care without a permanent family placement. Although same-sex couples are 7 times more likely to foster or adopt than their different-sex counterparts, many child-placing agencies refuse to serve same-sex couples and LGBTQ individuals. This has resulted in a reduction of the pool of qualified and available homes for youth in the child welfare system who need placement on a temporary or permanent basis. It also sends a negative message about LGBTQ people to children and youth in the child welfare system about who is, and who is not, considered fit to be a parent. While the priority should be on providing the supports necessary to keep children with their families, when removal is required, barring discrimination in foster care and adoption will increase the number of homes available to foster children waiting for foster and adoptive families.\n(21)\nLGBTQ youth are overrepresented in the foster care system by at least a factor of two and report twice the rate of poor treatment while in care compared to their non-LGBTQ counterparts. LGBTQ youth in foster care have a higher average number of placements, higher likelihood of living in a group home, and higher rates of hospitalization for emotional reasons and of juvenile justice involvement than their non-LGBTQ peers because of the high level of bias and discrimination that they face and the difficulty of finding affirming foster placements. Further, due to their physical distance from friends and family, traumatic experiences, and potentially unstable living situations, all youth involved with child welfare services are at risk for being targeted by traffickers seeking to exploit children. Barring discrimination in child welfare services will ensure improved treatment and outcomes for LGBTQ foster children.\n(22)\nCourts consistently have found that the government has a compelling interest in preventing and remedying discrimination. For example, the Supreme Court of the United States found there to be a compelling government interest in eliminating sex discrimination in Board of Directors of Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537, 549 (1987). Because discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity inherently is a form of sex discrimination, as held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), this Act furthers the compelling government interest in providing redress for the serious harms to mental and physical health, financial security and wellbeing, civic participation, freedom of movement and opportunity, personal dignity, and physical safety that result from discrimination. Consistent with the role nondiscrimination laws play in protecting lives and livelihoods, alleviating suffering, and improving individual and public health, the Supreme Court of the United States has long recognized, under the decision in Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964), that these laws also benefit society as a whole by ending the\ndisruptive effect\n(23)\nAs with all prohibitions on invidious discrimination, this Act furthers the government\u2019s compelling interest in the least restrictive way because only by forbidding discrimination is it possible to avert or redress the harms described in this subsection.\n(b)\nPurpose\nIt is the purpose of this Act to expand as well as clarify, confirm and create greater consistency in the protections and remedies against discrimination on the basis of all covered characteristics and to provide guidance and notice to individuals, organizations, corporations, and agencies regarding their obligations under the law.\n3.\nPublic
